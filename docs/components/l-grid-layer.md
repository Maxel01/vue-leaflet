# LGridLayer

> Creates a map layer where each tile is an instantiated Vue component.
> Each tile component is given `coords` props by `LGridLayer` to indicate
> the zoom level and position of the tile
> (see https://leafletjs.com/examples/extending/extending-2-layers.html#lgridlayer-and-dom-elements).

::: warning

From [Vue Leaflet](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/blob/master/src/playground/views/GridLayerDemo.vue) :

TODO NEXT: While sorting out type errors in LGridLayer.vue, I realized I'm not sure
how or even if its infrastructure is particularly used well. In Vue2Leaflet,
you could pass an arbitrary Vue component to the LGridLayer, to be rendered
for each tile with its coords passed as props. But that doesn't seem set up here.
Should we replicate V2L exactly here? Set things up so that the LGridLayer's $slot
can be where/how the component is setup/configured/passed/added? Simply stick with
the `childRender` prop and simplify some of the logic in LGridLayer.vue?

## Demo

<script setup>
import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css";
import { LMap, LTileLayer, LGridLayer } from '../../src/lib.ts';
import { h } from 'vue';

const childRender = (props) => () => {
  return h(
    "div",
    { style: "border: 1px solid grey; height: 100%;" },
    `x: ${props.coords.x} y: ${props.coords.y} z: ${props.coords.z}`
  );
}
</script>

<LMap style="height: 350px" :zoom="8" :center="[47.21322, -1.559482]">
  <LTileLayer
    url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
    attribution="&amp;copy; <a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;>OpenStreetMap</a> contributors"
    layer-type="base"
    name="OpenStreetMap"
  />
  <LGridLayer
    :child-render="childRender"
  />
</LMap>

```vue{8-10,13-28}
