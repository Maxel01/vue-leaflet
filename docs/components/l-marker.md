## Props

| Prop name | Description | Type | Reactive | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| draggable | Whether the marker is draggable with mouse/touch or not. | `boolean` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |

| zIndexOffset | By default, marker images zIndex is set automatically based on its latitude. Use this option if you want to put the marker on top of all others (or below), specifying a high value like 1000 (or high negative value, respectively). | `number` | `true` | `-` | `false` |
| latLng | The position of the marker | `LatLngExpression` | `true` | `-` | `true` |
