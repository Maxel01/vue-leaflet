## Props

| Prop name | Description | Type | Reactive | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tms | If `true`, inverses Y axis numbering for tiles (turn this on for TMS services) | `boolean` | `?` | `-` | `false` |
| subdomains | Subdomains of the tile service. Can be passed in the form of one string (where each letter is a subdomain name) or an array of strings. | `string \| Array` | `?` | `-` | `false` |
| detectRetina | If `true` and user is on a retina display, it will request four tiles of half the specified size and a bigger zoom level in place of one to utilize the high resolution. | `boolean` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| url | A string of the form `'https://{s}.somedomain.com/blabla/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'`. See more in the [original Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-2.0.0.html#tilelayer) | `string` | `true` | `-` | `true` |

### Inherited props
<details>
<summary>from <strong>GridLayerAbstractProps</strong></summary>

| Prop name | Description | Type | Reactive | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| className | A custom class name to assign to the tile layer. Empty by default. | `string` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| maxZoom | The maximum zoom level up to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive) | `number` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| minZoom | The minimum zoom level down to which this layer will be displayed (inclusive) | `number` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| noWrap | Whether the layer is wrapped around the antimeridian. If true, the GridLayer will only be displayed once at low zoom levels. Has no effect when the [map CRS](https://leafletjs.com/reference-2.0.0.html#map-crs) doesn't wrap around. Can be used in combination with `bounds` to prevent requesting tiles outside the CRS limits. | `boolean` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| tileSize | Width and height of tiles in the grid. Use a number if width and height are equal, or `Point(width, height)` otherwise. | `number \| PointExpression` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
| zIndex | The explicit zIndex of the tile layer | `number` | `true` | `-` | `false` |
| opacity | Opacity of the tiles. Can be used in the createTile() function. | `number` | `true` | `-` | `false` |

Not effective if the renderer option is set (the renderer option will override the pane option). | `string` | `initOnly` | `-` | `false` |
