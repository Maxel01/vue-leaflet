# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.1] - 2023-06-16

### Added

- Utility functions are exported from the library.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-06-15

### Added

- Injection keys and exported values from function folder are now accessible through the lib.
- The [Leaflet `className` option](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#gridlayer-classname) is now available on `LGridLayer` and components that extend it.

### Fixed

- Playground works again after upgrade to TypeScript.
- LMap events fire once only, and with Leaflet arguments, closing
  [#287 Click event not working with 0.9.0](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/287).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** The `src` directory is no longer included in the build. Please use the new exports to access the injection keys and libary functions.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-03-12

### Added

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and a few initial tests.
- TypeScript type declarations in compiled output.

### Changed

- Converted codebase to TypeScript, finally closing
  [#1 Typescript support](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/1).

## [0.8.4] - 2023-02-20

### Fixed

- Improved how the `<LMarker>` decides when not to render the default icon, resolving an additional issue surfaced
  in [#266 Vue-leaflet LPopup does not update with prop change](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/266).
- Reinstated use of the Leaflet global `L` by default, unintentionally removed in
  [1bb4a71](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/commit/1bb4a71fa1201f6cf392e85a707a52bd8e916b9a#diff-c062e5b98deef6d3ca2604206fe64f4ac3a74887e252285b8559ee1e08e1b932R132-R135),
  resolving [#260 Geoman integration with Vue3 Leaflet](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/260).

## [0.8.3] - 2023-02-12

### Fixed

- The marker icon passed to the Leaflet constructor is now only replaced with an empty div when there is
  additional content within the `<LMarker>` component, _and_ at least some of that content is something
  other than a tooltip or popup, resolving
  [#269 Marker with tooltip no longer visible with v0.8.2](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/269).
- Tweaked how popups and tooltips are unbound when they unmount, resolving
  [#266 Vue-leaflet LPopup does not update with prop change](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/266).

### Changed

- Leaflet objects accessed via the `leafletObject` property of a `ref` are now all marked as raw, so they
  no longer return `Proxy` instances.

### Added

- Ability to style GeoJSON layers through `:options-style` prop.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-02-05

### Fixed

- Debounced event handlers are now cleared on unmount, resolving
  [#231 Possible Regression](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/231).
- Reworked attribution update handler to resolve
  [#165 Error when updating attribution prop for tileLayer](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/165).
- Default Leaflet icon is replaced by an empty div initially when a Marker has content in its slot that has not
  yet rendered, resolving
  [#170 Blinking default marker when using custom icon component](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/170).
- Resolved [#138 vue3 this.$slots.default is not a function](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/138).

### Changed

- `LTileLayer` now accepts an array of strings for its `subdomains` property, as well as a single string.
- `LWmsTileLayer` now uses the correct Leaflet option name `uppercase` instead of the previous `upperCase`.

## [0.8.1] - 2023-01-29

### Fixed

- Resolved [#265 TypeError: this.getPane() is undefined](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/issues/265).

## [0.8.0] - 2023-01-26

### Added

- Import of Leaflet CSS in quickstart.
- Example of using HTML inside an `LIcon` component, to create a `DivIcon`.

### Fixed

- Leaflet component defaults are no longer replaced with `undefined` when not set explicitly.
- Resolved some errors caused by event handlers attempting to run after components had unmounted.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `LWmsTileLayer` no longer has its own `baseUrl` property in addition to the `url` property it inherits
  from `LTileLayer`.

## [0.7.0] - 2022-12-08

### Breaking changes

- The `<l-map>` component now uses the globally available `window.L` instance of Leaflet by default.
  If you are using SSR in an existing project and relying on the default behaviour, you will now need to pass
  `:useGlobalLeaflet="false"` to your `<l-map>`.

### Added

- This changelog file.
- Quickstart and SSR sections in readme.

### Changed

- Minor additional updates to the readme.
- Code formatting in some playground examples.
- Moved `@types/leaflet` to `devDependencies`.
