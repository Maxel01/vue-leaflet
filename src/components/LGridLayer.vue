 * ::: warning
 *
 * From [Vue Leaflet legacy v1](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet/blob/master/src/playground/views/GridLayerDemo.vue) :
 *
 * TODO NEXT: While sorting out type errors in LGridLayer.vue, I realized I'm not sure
 * how or even if its infrastructure is particularly used well. In Vue2Leaflet,
 * you could pass an arbitrary Vue component to the LGridLayer, to be rendered
 * for each tile with its coords passed as props. But that doesn't seem set up here.
 * Should we replicate V2L exactly here? Set things up so that the LGridLayer's $slot
 * can be where/how the component is setup/configured/passed/added? Simply stick with
 * the `childRender` prop and simplify some of the logic in LGridLayer.vue?
